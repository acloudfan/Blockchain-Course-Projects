Students are encouraged to carry out the project on their own. The shell contract is provided as a guide. Feel free to reach out to me anytime you have a question

Do share your final contract with others....you can share the gihub link or ask me to add on my github.

Extra credit for anyone who can do a web app UI for this contract .... will host it on TheDapps.com

Happy Learning,

Regards
Raj
